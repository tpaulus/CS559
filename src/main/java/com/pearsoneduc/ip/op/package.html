Provides classes implementing standard image processing operations.
<p>
Images are generally manipulated as
{@link java.awt.image.BufferedImage} objects.
Many of the classes implement the standard
{@link java.awt.image.BufferedImageOp} interface,
making them plug-compatible with the small number of image
processing operations provided as part of the Java2D API.
